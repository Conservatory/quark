Description of change made in pywebkit to make it coordinate with
Quark

The pywebkit library provides a thin interfacing layer from the C
implementation of Webkit to Python. The pywebkit is an ongoing
project, and it does not expose all internal data structures in Webkit
to Python. Therefore, we added a couple more Python interfaces in
pywebkit so that our tab process implemented in Python is fully
functional.

The list of changes we made in other existing libsoup files are as
follows.

./webkit/webkit-1.0.2.defs
-- we added an interface definition for load_status()
