Changes in libsoup from 2.33.92 to 2.34.0:

	* Fixed the GMainContext handling of the new
          SoupProxyResolverDefault (which among other things fixes
          gstreamer usage inside epiphany). [#646201, Sebastian Dröge]

	* Tweaked the introspection Makefile rules to fix a problem
          building on Debian/Ubuntu. [#645505]

	* Belated bumped the shared library versioning to reflect the
          API additions since 2.32.0

Changes in libsoup from 2.33.90 to 2.33.92:

	* LIBSOUP NO LONGER DEPENDS ON GCONF OR LIBPROXY.
	  (see below).

	* Added SoupProxyResolverDefault, which uses uses gio's
          GProxyResolver to resolve proxies [#642982, Gustavo Noronha
          Silva]. Despite the "default" in the name, it is not used by
          default, for compatibility reasons, but it is available in
          plain libsoup, not libsoup-gnome. (Of course, it depends on
          having glib-networking installed.)

	* Updated SoupProxyResolverGNOME to be based on
          SoupProxyResolverDefault, but explicitly requesting the
          "gnome" GProxyResolver if it is available [#625898], and
          removed the old code that used GConf and libproxy directly.

	* Added soup_server_disconnect(), to explicitly disconnect a
          SoupServer, since it is not possible to g_object_unref() it
          from memory-managed language bindings. [#638576, Andreas
          Rottmann]

	* SoupDate now parses month names case-insensitively [#644048,
          Christian Dywan]

	* Avoid a g_return_if_fail() when using
          SOUP_COOKIE_JAR_ACCEPT_NO_THIRD_PARTY with non-http URIs
          (file:, data:, etc). [#643226]

	* SoupCookieJar now catches overflows when parsing very
          distant dates [#643462, based on a patch from Mark
          Starovoytov]

	* Fixed a buggy interaction between request body streaming and
          restarted requests [David Woodhouse]. Added some new tests
          to tests/chunk-test.c to make sure that a specific
          (unsupported!) way of using those methods would not get
          broken in the future.

	* Fixed soup_socket_get_remote_address(), which had been
          broken since 2.33.4 (and which in turn caused
          soup_client_context_get_address/_get_host to be broken).
          [#645227]

Changes in libsoup from 2.33.6 to 2.33.90:

	* Attempted to make libsoup's dependency on glib-networking
          (for TLS support) more explicit, by requiring that
          glib-networking be present at compile time unless the
          builder explicitly passes "--disable-tls-check", and noting
          that packagers should give libsoup a runtime dependency on
          glib-networking.

	* Fixed a bug in talking to servers with virtual hosts with
          Unicode names (IDNs) [#642075]

	* Added a "Connection: Keep-Alive" header when talking to
          HTTP/1.0 hosts, to improve performance. [#640414, Sergio
          Villar Senin]

	* Changed SoupCache to not cache multipart/x-mixed-replace
          content. [#642028, Sergio Villar Senin]

Changes in libsoup from 2.33.5 to 2.33.6:

	* Made SoupSessionAsync do idle-connection cleanup more
          sanely, resulting in faster load times for pages with lots
          of subresources. [#639768, Sergio Villar Senin]

	* Fixed soup_form_decode()'s behavior (and by extension,
          SoupServer query string handling) with datasets that contain
          multiple values for the same key, and added a test case.
          [#639783, Sven Neumann]

	* Fixed warnings pointed out by gcc 4.6, including a bug in
          SoupCache that would cause unnecessary revalidations
          [#640556].

	* Belated copied a fix from the WebKit copy of soup-cache.c
          into ours, and fixed a bug in the local copy of
          soup-request-data.c [#641022, Sergio Villar Senin], in
          preparation for making WebKit use the libsoup versions.

Changes in libsoup from 2.33.4 to 2.33.5:

	* Fixed certain cases of soup_session_cancel_message() with
	  SoupSessionSync that could previously cause warnings or
	  crashes. [#637741]

Changes in libsoup from 2.32.2 to 2.33.4:

	* SoupSocket now uses GSocketConnection and GTlsConnection
	  internally rather than making socket calls directly and
	  using GIOStream, and TLS is handled via glib's APIs rather
	  than using gnutls directly.

        * The gzip Content-Encoding handler is now implemented using
          GZlibDecompressor

	* As a result of the above two changes, libsoup no longer
	  directly depends on gnutls, libgcrypt, or zlib, though it
	  still indirectly depends on zlib via glib and libxml2. Also,
	  although libsoup does not depend on glib-networking as a
	  build-time dependency, some "make check" tests will be
	  skipped if it is not installed.

	* The SoupRequest/SoupCache code from WebKit has been
          imported, but it is not yet recommended for general use, and
          is not necessarily API stable. [#523100, Sergio Villar, with
          the SoupRequest parts based on the Summer of Code work by
          Gabriel Corvalan and the cache parts based on an earlier
          patch by Xan Lopez]

	* Added SoupMessage:tls-certificate and
          SoupMessage:tls-errors, which give more information about
	  the certificate used to authenticate a TLS connection.

	* It is now possible to disable Basic or Digest auth in a
          session by using soup_session_remove_feature_by_type() with
          SOUP_TYPE_AUTH_BASIC or SOUP_TYPE_AUTH_DIGEST. Likewise, the
          right way to enable NTLM support now is to call
          soup_session_add_feature_by_type() with SOUP_TYPE_AUTH_NTLM;
          SOUP_SESSION_USE_NTLM is now deprecated.

	* Allow setting cookies on file:// URIs, since other browsers
          do, and WebKit has a test for it. [#603825]

	* .gir/.typelib files now include C header/library information
          (needed by vala and some other bindings) [#635395, Evan
          Nemerson]

	* Added annotations on soup_message_headers_get_content_type()
          [Lucas Rocha] and SoupHTTPVersion [John Palmieri]

	* Fixed a Set-Cookie processing leak [#636741, Jonathan
          Jongsma]

Changes in libsoup from 2.32.1 to 2.32.2:

	* Fixed a regression in 2.32.0 that caused evolution-exchange
          to get stuck and stop updating. [#634422]

	* Fixed a regression in 2.32.0 with apps using asynchronous
          sessions from multiple threads (in particular, gupnp)
          [#635101]

	* Fixed the regression test for #631525 to not cause spurious
	  "make check" failures on some machines.

Changes in libsoup from 2.32.0 to 2.32.1:

	* Fixed a regression in 2.32.0 with the use of persistent
	  connections that caused spurious "Connection terminated
	  unexpectedly" errors. [#631525, debugged by Sergio Villar]

	* Fixed a regression in 2.32.0 that caused proxy-related
	  DNS errors to return SOUP_STATUS_CANT_RESOLVE rather than
	  SOUP_STATUS_CANT_RESOLVE_PROXY.

	* Usernames/passwords specified explicitly in request URIs now
	  override existing cached auth info. [#631679, Sergio Villar]

	* Changed soup_uri_decode() and soup_uri_normalize() to just
	  ignore malformed %-encoding rather than returning NULL,
	  for consistency with soup_uri_new(). [#630540]

	* Fixed soup_form_decode() to ignore invalid parameters,
	  and soup_form_encode_hash() to just g_return_if_fail()
	  rather than crashing if there are NULL values in the
	  hash. [#620220]

	* Added another workaround for stupid servers that close the
	  connection before returning the full response (in this case,
	  when using chunked encoding and failing to include the
	  final 0-length chunk). [#629160]

	* Fixed a bug in SoupCookieJarText that deleted excess cookies
	  whenever any cookie expired. [#631641, Michał Kazior]

	* Fixed a small leak in SoupContentDecoder if you were using
	  it incorrectly. [pointed out in email by Christophe
	  Gillette]

	* Added regression tests for passwords-in-URIs [#631679,
	  Sergio Villar] and SOUP_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT.

Changes in libsoup from 2.31.92 to 2.32.0:

	* (No changes, just a version bump)

Changes in libsoup from 2.31.90 to 2.31.92:

	* Updated for gobject-introspection 0.9.5. Also added some new
          annotations and removed a bunch of private headers from the
          scanning process.

	* Percent-encoded characters in URIs are no longer
          automatically normalized to uppercase, since apparently some
          servers are stupid. [#628728, Sergio Villar Senin]

	* Fixed a crash when resolving a URI containing both spaces
          and non-UTF8 8bit characters. [#629449]

Changes in libsoup from 2.31.2 to 2.31.90:

	* libsoup now tries to connect to each IP address associated
          with a hostname, if the first one fails. In particular, if a
          host has both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and only one of them
          is reachable from the current host, libsoup will now try the
          other one rather than failing. (libc is supposed to sort the
          IP addresses in the right order, such that, eg, if you don't
          have IPv6 connectivity, it will put the IPv4 address first.
          For some reason though, this seems to be broken on some
          distros.) [#526321].

	* Fixed Accept-Language header generation in locales where ","
          is used as the decimal point.

Changes in libsoup from 2.31.2 to 2.31.6:

	* Disabled TLS 1.2 in addition to the already-disabled 1.1 and
          1.0 [see below, in libsoup 2.27.2], thus making libsoup
          usable with gnutls 2.10. [#622857. This commit, 01a43ad9,
          can be applied to libsoup 2.30.x as well if you need that
          release to work with gnutls 2.10.]

	* When using libproxy 0.3 or newer, libsoup no longer leaks
          proxy-related environment variables into child processes
          [#603285]

	* Changed the way message/connection binding works in
          SoupSession so that (among other things), when there are
          multiple requests queued to a host, and one of them gets a
          network error, the other requests are still allowed to try
          to succeed, rather than all failing immediately. [#619633]

	* SoupSession now limits the number of times a message can be
	  redirected, to avoid infinite loops [#604383, José Millán
	  Soto]

	* Fixed handling of certain messages where the response
          headers included "Connection: close" but the server did not
          actually close the connection at the end. [#611481]

	* Fixed some incorrect g-i annotations [#621021]

	* Fixed an out-of-bounds memory access when processing certain
          Set-Cookie headers [#620288]

	* Improved msg->reason_phrase on network errors [#623274]

	* Fixed gir file disting [#621727, Yaakov Selkowitz]

Changes in libsoup from 2.30.1 to 2.31.2:

	* gobject-introspection has now been merged in. Use
          --enable-introspection to build. [#576595, Andreas Rottmann]
	  Note that the introspected API is not yet stable, and in
	  particular, there are numerous values annotated as "utf8"
	  which are actually not guaranteed to be utf8. (Eg, most
	  header data.)

		* Added some helper functions for bindings:
                  soup_buffer_new_take(),
                  soup_message_body_append_take(), and
                  soup_buffer_get_data(). [#576595, Andreas Rottmann]

		* Also added properties for several SoupMessage public
                  fields, and getter methods for various boxed types
                  (SoupCookie, SoupDate, SoupURI).

		* Added some additional hash-table annotations.
                  [#619086, Gustavo Noronha Silva]

	* Marked SoupSession abstract. [#617216, Lorenzo Gil, the
          first bug filed by someone trying to use libsoup via
          introspection!] Likewise for SoupAuth and SoupAuthDomain.

	* Fixed a problem with SoupSessionAsync that would cause
          messages to get lost if you aborted a previous message while
          it was still looking up the hostname. Fixed several other
          problems that were discovered while adding a regression test
          for that. [#618641, thanks to Claudio Saavedra for a good
          test case]

	* Fixed another connecting-to-lame-http-server problem, and a
          getting-stuck-in-a-loop-reconnecting bug that it revealed.
          [#615535]

Changes in libsoup from 2.30.0 to 2.30.1:

	* Fix for https through proxies that close the connection when
          returning a "407 Proxy Authentication Required" response,
          and add a regression test for that case. [#611663]

	* Fixed multiple forms/multipart-related interoperability
          problems reported by Egon Andersen:

		* Don't quote the multipart boundary string if it's
                  not needed, since RFC 2616 recommends that you
                  don't, and some servers don't handle quotes there
                  correctly. (Sigh.) [#614176]

		* Don't put an extra blank line before the first
                  multipart part, since it's unnecessary and some
                  servers don't handle a multipart preamble correctly.
                  (Sigh.) [#614183]

		* Don't put Content-Transfer-Encoding headers in the
                  multipart/form-data parts, even though the HTML 4
                  spec says you must, since no other browsers do, and
                  some servers don't handle them correctly. (Sigh.)
                  [#614198]

	* Changed SoupCookieJarSqlite to actually erase deleted
          cookies from the database. [#615711, Lukasz Slachciak]

	* Fixed SoupLogger to be more robust against getting passed
          bad data by the session. [#611663]

	* Fixed SoupAuthDomain to ignore paths when doing proxy auth

	* Fixed a g_warning when hovering over a javascript link in
          WebKit. [#613442, Xan Lopez]

Changes in libsoup from 2.29.91 to 2.30.0:

	* Fixed a crash in the whitespace-stripping code in
          soup_uri_new() [#612644, "arnaud.lb"]

	* Update content-sniffing algorithm to match Chrome and the
          soon-to-be-updated sniffing spec. [#611502, Gustavo Noronha
          Silva]

	* We now handle "Content-Encoding: x-gzip" as well as "gzip"
	  (even though "x-gzip" has been deprecated for more than 10
	  years). [#611476]

	* Fixed leaks found by valgrind

	* Make the "make check" programs only bind to 127.0.0.1, not
          any public network interfaces. [#609489, Saleem Absulrasool]

	* Add a test to sniffing-test to make sure that Content-Type
          parameters are preserved correctly. [Gustavo Noronha Silva]

Changes in libsoup from 2.29.90 to 2.29.91:

	* Added SOUP_SESSION_SSL_STRICT and
          SOUP_MESSAGE_CERTIFICATE_TRUSTED, to allow callers to
          determine if an https response comes from a server with a
          recognized/valid or unrecognized/invalid certificate.
          [#610374, Gustavo Noronha Silva]

	* Fixed handling of certain badly-formatted URIs [#590524]

Changes in libsoup from 2.29.6 to 2.29.90:

	* Added soup_cookie_jar_set_accept_policy() and related API
          for implementing cookie acceptance policies. [#608353, Xan
          Lopez]

	* Fixed the "request-read" signal in SoupServer to actually be
          emitted.

Changes in libsoup from 2.29.5 to 2.29.6:

	* Fixed SoupContentDecoder to ignore trailing junk after the
          encoded message body (as other browsers do), rather than
          getting stuck in an infinite loop. [#606352]

	* Fixed an invalid read in soup_cookie_applies_to_uri()
	  [#607024, pointed out by Xan]

	* Fixed linking on OS X [#606959]

	* Removed a harmless warning in SoupServer. [#606645]

Changes in libsoup from 2.29.3 to 2.29.5:

	* Added SoupContentDecoder, providing support for
          Content-Encoding: gzip for WebKitGTK. [#522772]

	* Added "accept-language" and "accept-language-auto"
          properties to SoupSession, to support the Accept-Language
          header. [#597004, Mario Sanchez Prada]

	* Fixed a bug in SoupPasswordManagerGNOME that could cause
          crashes if you typed the wrong password once and then tried
          again. [#595554, debugged by Gustavo Noronha Silva]

	* Fixed a crash in SoupAuthDigest if the server claims support
          for both qop=auth and qop=auth-int. (This was not noticed
          sooner because no one actually supports qop=auth-int, and
          the server in question here was probably confused. :)

	* Updated cookie parsing/output to more closely match
	  draft-ietf-httpstate-cookie-00. [Also fixes #603496 (WebKit
	  unit test), and #604794 (hang parsing malformed Set-Cookie
	  header)]

	* Fixed https-via-proxy to not hang if there is an error
          communicating with the proxy immediately after the TLS
          negotiation. [#587528]

	* Fixed a bug that broke gobject-introspection's introspection
          of libsoup. [#603696, Vincent Untz]

	* Handle spurious CR/LFs between responses. [#602863,
          Alexander V. Butenko]

	* Fixed soup-message-client-io to not erroneously include URI
          fragments on the Request-Line when sending via a proxy.
          [Related to WebKit bug #28687]

	* Fixed Digest authentication against certain (buggy?)
          clients/servers that require you to use quotes in exactly the
          same places where the spec uses them. [#582219]

	* Fix ugly gtype-related hack to work with the latest unstable
          glib. [Benjamin Otte]

Changes in libsoup from 2.28.1 to 2.29.3:

	* Fixed a crash in SoupCookieJarSqlite when using cookie
          databases not created by libsoup (eg, upgraded epiphany
          installations). [Patch from Emilio Pozuelo Monfort]

	* Fixed SoupCookieJar to handle non-http URIs properly (so
          that, eg, JavaScript bookmarklets that try to set/read
          cookies won't cause crashes). [#602498]

	* HEAD requests that receive a "303 See Other" response will
	  now do a HEAD, not a GET, on the redirected-to resource.
	  Fixes gvfs access to some sites, including certain
	  youtube.com URIs. [#600830]

	* Fixed a g_warning that would always trigger in the
          server-side SoupCookie code. [#602389]

	* Fixed the server-side SoupMultipart code to be able to parse
          multiparts containing binary attachments, rather than
          rejecting them as malformed. [#601640]

	* Fixed the Request-Line format in the https-over-proxy case.
          Among other things, this fixes access to bugzilla.gnome.org
          from WebKitGTK-based browsers. [#598277, #600826]

	* Fixed a leak in SoupSession if a message was cancelled while
          the initial socket connection was in progress. [#596074,
          debugged by Arnout Vandecappelle]

	* Fixed server-side parsing of Digest auth. [#602898, Chris
          Head]

	* Fixed WinSock initialization on Windows. [#600689, Tor
          Lillqvist]

	* Fixed a sporadic crash in the SSL code on Windows. [#600748,
          Tor Lillqvist]

	* Fixed handling of https connections with timeouts on
          Windows. [#600749, Tor Lillqvist]

	* Added soup_session_prepare_for_uri(), to allow DNS
          prefetching for faster browsing. [#598948, José Millán Soto]

	* SoupSession now avoids redundant DNS lookups again when
          first connecting to a new site, resulting in (probably
          imperceptibly) faster loads.

	* Added some debugging APIs to SoupConnection and SoupSession
          for use by, eg, epiphany's soup-fly extension. [#589163,
          José Millán Soto]

Changes in libsoup from 2.28.0 to 2.28.1:

	* libsoup will now attempt to make multiple connections to a
          server at once when there are multiple messages queued to
          that server. The previous behavior (only allowing a single
          pending connection to each server) resulted in slow load
          times on pages with lots of subresources (images, css, js,
          etc) on servers that disallow persistent connections.
          [#594768]

	* There should now be fewer (no?) "Connection terminated
          unexpectedly" errors in WebKitGTK.

	* Fixed a crash in SoupCookieJarSqlite [#596859, patch from
          Alexander Sack].

	* Fixed soup_address_get_physical() and address-to-name
          resolution of SoupAddress [patch from Enrico Tröger].

	* Fixed a bug in SoupContentSniffer that could cause false
          negatives [#597545, patch from Alejandro Castro].

	* Fixed the configure error if you have gnutls-devel but not
          gcrypt-devel installed [#587709].

Changes in libsoup from 2.27.92 to 2.28.0:

	* Fixed a handful of leaks found with valgrind, including a
          large one in SoupContentSniffer [WebKit bug 28148].

	* Changed the behavior of SoupCookieJarSqlite to improve
          performance. [#584522, patch from Gustavo Noronha Silva]

	* Fixed a crash in SoupSocket that affected gupnp. [#594951,
          patch from Olivier Crête]

	* Fixed the type of the SOUP_METHOD_* and SOUP_URI_SCHEME_*
          macros to be const char * rather than gpointer. [#594508]

Changes in libsoup from 2.27.91 to 2.27.92:

	* Removed SoupPasswordManager from the public API until its
          problems can be addressed. Although it is still present, you
          need to #define a special symbol for it to be visible in the
          header files; see #594377 for details.

	* Fixed a bug where empty query components were dropped from
          URIs. [#594405]

	* Fixed "make check" to work (but warn) when building with
          --disable-ssl.

	* Fixed some small documentation bugs pointed out by Dominik
          Bylica and Lucian Langa.

Changes in libsoup from 2.27.90 to 2.27.91:

	* Added SoupPasswordManager, an interface for managing
	  persistent password storage, and SoupPasswordManagerGNOME
	  (in libsoup-gnome), which implements it using gnome-keyring.
	  tests/get.c provides a minimal example of how to use it.

	* libsoup should now notice when the server closes a
          persistent connection, and close its side of the connection
          sooner. This should hopefully fix the spurious "Connection
          terminated unexpectedly" errors in WebKitGTK. [#578990]

	* Fixed some problems with connection management in
          SoupSession that could cause a session to eventually "stall"
          and be unable to process new requests. [#592084]

	* Fixed an infinite loop that caused 100% CPU usage if the
          network went down at exactly the right time while there were
          unsent messages in the queue. [#592492]

	* Fixed a crash in SoupLogger. [#591857]

	* Fixed the definition of soup_message_is_keepalive() for
          HTTP/1.0 messages, to fix a problem introduced in 2.27.90
          where some messages would load completely but never emit
          "finished".

	* Fixed a crash in SoupServer introduced in 2.27.90 when
          processing a request with no "Host" header.

Changes in libsoup from 2.27.5 to 2.27.90:

	* libsoup now uses glib's GResolver rather than its own DNS
          code. For 2.27.90, the only visible change should be that
          internationalized domain names are now supported. [#548287]

	* Added soup_message_disable_feature(), which allows you to
          disable particular features (eg, cookies, proxy,
          content-sniffing, etc) on a per-message basis. [#574773]

	* It is now possible to implement "OPTIONS *" in a SoupServer;
          you must explicitly register a handler for "*" in order to
          do this. [#590751]

	* Ignore Content-Length on EOF-terminated responses, to match
          other browsers and therefore cope with broken servers that
          send the wrong length. [Patch from Benjamin Otte.]

	* Fixed the status code when trying to fetch an https URI with
          a non-gnutls build of libsoup. [#590464]

	* Fixed strict-aliasing warnings introduced in 2.27.4
          [#588771]

	* Fixed some warnings noted by fortify [#591226] and -Wextra.

	* libsoup now uses automake 1.11's silent-rules support by
          default (if you are building with automake 1.11). Use
          "./configure --disable-silent-rules" or "make V=1" to
          disable.

Changes in libsoup from 2.27.4 to 2.27.5:

	* Fixed a crash when a web server redirected a request to a
          non-http URI (eg, "about:blank"). [#528882]

	* Fixed a hang when trying to create an attachment on certain
          bugzilla installations from epiphany. [#584645]

	* Fixed verification of V1 TLS certificates [#589323, Patrick
          Ohly]

	* Fixed compile problems on Windows (in the ssl code), and on
          Linux (when the most recent version of gtk-doc was
          installed).

Changes in libsoup from 2.27.2 to 2.27.4:

	* Added SoupContentSniffer and the "content-sniffed" signal on
          SoupMessage, to do Content-Type sniffing per the HTML5 /
          draft-abarth-mime-sniff algorithm. [#572589, Gustavo Noronha
          Silva]

	* Updated the earlier SoupSession timeout fixes ([#574414],
          [#578928]) so that async connect() also times out [#588177,
          Mark Nauwelaerts] and SSL works on Windows again [#587910,
          Fridrich Strba].

	* Fixed the behavior on a 301 response to a POST to match
          real-world usage rather than what the spec says. (We were
          doing the right thing on 302 and 303, but had missed 301.)
	  [#586692]

	* Changed configure so that if GNUTLS isn't found then it
	  errors out, rather than silently building an SSL-less
	  libsoup. Configure with --disable-ssl if you actually don't
	  want SSL. [#584955]

Changes in libsoup from 2.27.1 to 2.27.2:

	* Replaced SoupProxyResolver with SoupProxyURIResolver, which
          is a bit simpler, works with non-HTTP URIs (and so could be
          used by gvfsd-ftp) and supports proxy auth correctly.
          [#580051]

	* Fixed SoupSession to not try to resolve http server
          hostnames when it's just going to pass the hostname off to a
          proxy server anyway. This fixes things on hosts that use a
          proxy for everything and have no working DNS config
          [#577532] and also makes WebKitGTK behave more like other
          browsers in terms of per-host connection limits (we now
          limit connections based on hostname rather than on IP
          address).

	  We also no longer set the AI_CANONNAME flag when calling
	  getaddrinfo(), which saves us a little bit of unnecessary
	  network traffic. [Pointed out by Christophe Gillette on the
	  mailing list.]

	* libsoup now always uses SSL 3.0 (not TLS 1.0 or 1.1) for
          https URIs, to work around problems with older servers that
          don't implement the (apparently quite confusing) TLS/SSL
          compatibility rules correctly. Makes a bunch of
          previously-inaccessible sites now accessible in WebKitGTK
          (notably PayPal) [#581342]. Will eventually be revisited, to
          first try TLS 1.1 and fall back if that fails.

	* Fixed Digest auth to (recent) Apple CalDAV servers.
          [#583091]

	* Changed the way the SoupSession "authenticate" signal works
          a bit. We now never emit "authenticate" before sending a
          request, even if we know for sure that it's going to fail,
          because this makes the semantics of the authenticate handler
          too complicated (and because we'll only get into this
          situation if a previous call to the authenticate handler
          failed anyway). Fixes problems in WebKitGTK when you cancel
          a password dialog, and then later try to load the page
          again. [#583462, mostly figured out by Gustavo Noronha
          Silva].

	* Fixed a bug in the CRLF-vs-LF patch (#571283) that caused
          libsoup to fail to parse the response headers (returning
          SOUP_STATUS_MALFORMED) if a CR LF got split across two
          read()s. [#582002]

	* Allow using PUT in soup_form_request_for_data(), to work
          with certain broken web APIs. [#581860, Ross Burton]. Also,
          fixed a problem with empty POST bodies that made some parts
          of gmail not work in WebKitGTK.

	* Applied some minor bugfixes to configure.in and autogen.sh
          [#583911, #583942]. Fixed configure.in to not use gcc
          warning options that the installed version of gcc doesn't
          recognize [#578851].

	* Added G_GNUC_NULL_TERMINATED and G_GNUC_PRINTF to a few
          methods that should have had them. [#581754, Ross Burton]

Changes in libsoup from 2.26.1 to 2.27.1:

	* SOUP_SESSION_TIMEOUT now works properly with
          SoupSessionAsync [#574414] and SSL [#578928]. Added
          tests/timeout-test to test this.

	* SoupDate fixes:

		* soup_date_to_string() now handles SOUP_DATE_RFC2822
		  [#579055, Enrico Tröger]

		* soup_date_new_from_string() now accepts 24:00 as a
		  time in ISO8601 timestamps

		* soup_date_to_string() now coerces the date to UTC
		  for HTTP and cookie dates, and outputs the UTC
		  correct offset for the other date types.

		* Added regression tests to tests/date

	* soup_headers_parse() now completely ignores
          syntactically-incorrect headers, rather than passing them to
          soup_message_headers_append() and causing a g_warning.
          soup_message_headers_append() now also rejects 0-length
          header names. Updated tests/header-parsing to check this.
          [#579318]

	* Fix a crash when cancelling a message from a "restarted"
          handler, and updated a regression test to notice the
          underlying cause. [#580193]

	* Completing the API updates for #576760 from 2.26.1,
          soup_message_headers_get() is now marked deprecated in favor
          of soup_message_headers_get_one() and _get_list().

Changes in libsoup from 2.26.0 to 2.26.1:

	* libsoup uses libproxy for PAC and WPAD proxy resolution
          again. However, it arranges to do all communication with
          GConf itself, to ensure that libproxy doesn't call it in
          non-thread-safe ways. [#571527] Also, fixed a bug in
          SoupSessionSync when proxy resolution failed. [#574957,
          patch from Milan Crha].

	  (Also fixed three SoupProxyResolverGNOME bugs since the
	  2.26.0.9 preview release. [#578746, #578809])

	* SoupURI now handles unencoded spaces in URIs. In particular,
          redirects via Location headers with spaces in them now work.
          [#566530]

	* libsoup can now deal with servers (and clients) that
          erroneously use LF LF instead of CR LF CR LF to separate
          the headers and body. [#571283]

	* Added soup_message_headers_get_one() and
          soup_message_headers_get_list(), which will eventually
          deprecate soup_message_headers_get(). This lets applications
          deal correctly with implementations that erroneously send
          multiple copies of single-valued headers. [#576760]

	* In particular, soup_message_headers_get_content_type() now
          ignores duplicate Content-Type headers [#576760] and also
          ignores syntactically-incorrect Content-Type headers.
          [#577630]

	* SoupCookieJar can now store multiple cookies with the same
          domain and name, but different paths. [#577360]

	* Abnormal SSL connection closes are now treated as ordinary
          EOFs, for compatibility with certain sites. [#577386]

	* soup_header_g_string_append_param() now allows NULL values.
          [#577728]

	* soup_message_headers_append() now rejects header names and
          values with newlines or certain other illegal data in them,
          rather than generating syntactically invalid headers.

	* Fixed a small bug in soup_date_new_from_string's ISO 8601
          handling [qv #578369 for g_time_val_from_iso8601].

	* The regression tests now work correctly on machines where
          "localhost" resolves to "::1" instead of "127.0.0.1".
          [#576583, patch from Andreas Rottmann]

	* Fixed warnings when a message has a network problem when
          many other messages are queued. [#578809]

	* Miscellaneous documentation fixes/clarifications.

Changes in libsoup from 2.25.91 to 2.26.0:

	* Temporarily disable libproxy support to work around a bug in
          its gnome plugin that causes gvfsd-http (and probably
          eventually other apps) to crash. [#571527]. For now,
          SoupProxyResolverGNOME uses only GConf. To be fixed in
          2.26.1

	* Fixed a bug that showed up in WebKit, where if many messages
          were queued all at once to a server that doesn't support
          persistent connections, some of the requests will get lost.
          #574365, reported by Xan Lopez.

	* Fixed SoupServer to support using SOUP_ENCODING_EOF, so you
          can stream responses of unknown length to HTTP/1.0 clients.
          [#572153]. Added a regression test for this, and for chunked
          and Content-Length-based streaming.

	* Fixed several bugs that prevented SoupCookieJarSqlite from
          working. [#572409, patch from Xan Lopez]

	* Added G_{BEGIN,END}_DECLS guards to public headers that were
          missing it. (Xan Lopez)

	* Misc gtk-doc improvements

Changes in libsoup from 2.25.5 to 2.25.91:

	* Fixed a crash in SoupProxyResolverGNOME when the proxy
          requires authentication. (This does not make proxy
          authentication *work* yet, it just makes it not crash.)

	* Updated documentation

Changes in libsoup from 2.25.4 to 2.25.5:

	* SoupProxyResolverGConf (which was incomplete) is gone, and
          libsoup-gnome now requires libproxy, which is now officially
          an external dependency of GNOME.

	* Fixed a bug in SoupCookieJar that was making it send
          "Cookie: (null)" when it had no cookies for a site, which
          confused some web servers (WebKit bug 23240).

	* Fixed a bug with using SOUP_MEMORY_TEMPORARY buffers and
          soup_message_body_set_accumulate(FALSE). (Part of WebKit bug
          18343, noticed by Gustavo Noronha Silva.)

	* Fixed the build with non-gcc compilers

Changes in libsoup from 2.25.3 to 2.25.4:

	* Added soup_session_get_feature() and
          soup_session_get_features(), to query the features currently
          available in a session (which is needed by the patch in
	  https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=22624)

Changes in libsoup from 2.25.2 to 2.25.3:

	* Fixed a crash when using both cookies and a proxy. [#562191,
          Mark Lee]

	* Fixed soup_form_decode() to correctly handle forms with
          URI-encoded parameter names [#563302, Evan Nemerson] and
          added a regression test.

	* Fixed a crash in SoupProxyResolverGConf. [#563145]

Changes in libsoup from 2.25.1 to 2.25.2:

	* Fixed client behavior when presented with multiple auth
          types to choose the *strongest* auth type (eg, Digest)
          rather than the *weakest* one [#562339, Pontus Oldberg].
          Added a regression test for this.

	* Moved libsoup-gnome headers to a different directory to make
          it easier to split libsoup and libsoup-gnome into separate
          packages, and to ensure that things that only want to be
          looking at plain libsoup headers (like gir-repository) don't
          accidentally see the libsoup-gnome ones.

	* Some minor doc fixes

	* Fixed libsoup-gnome linking with --as-needed. [#559342]

Changes in libsoup from 2.24.1 to 2.25.1:

	libsoup 2.25.1 introduces a new library, libsoup-gnome, which
	will be used for features which are important to GNOME apps,
	but which require GNOME-specific libraries that non-GNOME apps
	may not want to add dependencies on.

	In 2.25.1, libsoup-gnome contains:

	    * SOUP_TYPE_PROXY_RESOLVER_GNOME, a SoupSessionFeature
              type that can be added to a SoupSession to provide
              automatic proxy handling via the GConf proxy keys. (See
              below) The default implementation uses libproxy, which
              also handles WPAD, PAC, etc, but if libproxy is not
              available it will use GConf directly, supporting only
              the basic HTTP proxy functionality.

	    * SoupCookieJarSqlite, a SoupSessionFeature that handles
              cookies and stores them in a Firefox 3-compatible sqlite
              file. (This is not actually a "GNOME-specific" feature,
              but I didn't want to make libsoup itself depend on
              sqlite, and I didn't want to make the dependency
              optional. This might change before 2.26.)

	    * SOUP_TYPE_GNOME_FEATURES_2_26: a SoupSessionFeature type
              that can be added to a SoupSession to add all
              GNOME-integration features that are available for 2.26;
              as of 2.25.1, this is just the GNOME proxy resolver, but
              by 2.26.0 it may also include gnome-keyring support and
              possibly other features.

	Applications/libraries that are currently doing GConf proxy
	lookup by hand can be updated as follows:

	    * Remove all of the existing code that listens to the
              GConf keys and sets SOUP_SESSION_PROXY_URI

	    * Change the configure check to require
	      "libsoup-gnome-2.4 >= 2.25.1" instead of "libsoup-2.4"

	    * #include <libsoup/soup-gnome.h>

	    * After creating your SoupSession, do:

	          soup_session_add_feature_by_type (session, SOUP_TYPE_PROXY_RESOLVER_GNOME);

	      (Or alternatively, use SOUP_SESSION_ADD_FEATURE_BY_TYPE
	      with soup_session_async_new_with_options() or
	      soup_session_sync_new_with_options().)


	Other new features and bug fixes in 2.25.1 include:

	* SoupCookieJarText, like SoupCookieJarSqlite, but using the
          old-style cookies.txt format, and in the base libsoup rather
          than libsoup-gnome.

	* Various bugfixes to SoupCookie and SoupCookieJar to fix the
          problems with cookies not working on certain sites.

	* The new SoupMultipart type provides support for multipart
          MIME bodies, and soup-form now includes several methods for
          generating and parsing multipart form data and file uploads.

	* SoupMessageHeaders now has methods for easy handling of the
	  Content-Type, Content-Disposition, Range, and Content-Range
	  headers. The Content-Disposition handling recognizes
	  RFC2231-encoded UTF-8 filenames.

	* SoupServer now automatically handles partial GET requests;
          if your server returns SOUP_STATUS_OK in response to a
          partial GET, libsoup will automatically convert it to a
          SOUP_STATUS_PARTIAL_CONTENT response with only the requested
          portions.

	Thanks to Xan Lopez and Diego Escalante Urrelo for their work
	on SoupCookie, SoupCookieJar, SoupCookieJarText, and
	SoupCookieJarSqlite.

Changes in libsoup from 2.24.0.1 to 2.24.1:

	* Fixed a crash when unreffing the session from a
          soup_session_queue_message() callback [#533473], and added
          regression test. In particular, this fixes a crash in
          seahorse when trying to connect to a non-responsive
          keyserver.

	* Fixed an infinite loop when giving a bad password to a site
          that uses non-standard capitalization in the
          WWW-Authenticate header (eg, gmail.com) [#536285].

	* Fixed a leak in SoupSessionAsync when using a non-default
          GMainContext. [addendum to #498509, Arnout Vandecappelle]
          Added additional code to the regression tests to make sure
          sessions and servers do not get leaked.

	* Fixed a leak in the XML-RPC code

	* Compile fixes for "gcc -pedantic" [#553976, Sander Dijkhuis]
          and -DG_DISABLE_DEPRECATED / -DG_DISABLE_SINGLE_INCLUDES
          [#557072, Cosimo Cecchi]

	* Patched xmlrpc-test to accept the incorrect response to
          test_echo() that php-xmlrpc gives when it's built against
          libxml2 >= 2.7.1 (qv http://bugs.php.net/45996), so that
	  I can "make distcheck"...

	* Updated generated documentation

Changes in libsoup from 2.23.92 to 2.24.0.1:

	* Reverted part of the fix for #528882, which caused the DAAP
          plugin in rhythmbox to crash. [#553466]

Changes in libsoup from 2.23.91 to 2.23.92:

	* Fixed the handling of a 302 response to a HEAD request,
	  which should NOT be treated like a 303 response. [#551190,
	  Jonathan Matthew]

Changes in libsoup from 2.23.6 to 2.23.91:

	* Fixed a crash in gvfs [#528882], though there is still an
          unknown bug there. As part of this fix, libsoup will now
          return an error if you try to do an operation on a non-HTTP
          URI. (Previously it was just treating any URI scheme except
          "https" as HTTP.)

	* Added soup_date_to_timeval() for gvfs. [#549006, patch from
          Bastien Nocera]

Changes in libsoup from 2.23.1 to 2.23.6:

	* Fixed use of g_idle_add() so that heavy I/O won't end up
          blocking libsoup callbacks. [#536676, Benjamin Otte]

	* Allow the caller to override the Host header. [#539803, Marc
          Maurer]

	* Properly handle responses larger than 4G. [#539861, Peter
          Christensen]

	* Fixed the build when using certain LDFLAGS [#541506, Götz
          Waschk]

	* Fixed a small bug in Digest auth handling. [#544681, Mads
          Chr. Olesen]

	* Fixed multiple Windows bugs [Tor Lillqvist]

Changes in libsoup from 2.4.1 to 2.23.1:

	* This is the first unstable release leading up to GNOME 2.24.
          Bumped the libsoup version number up to 2.23.x to match the
          GNOME version; note that the API version is still "2.4",
          meaning in particular that you still call it "libsoup-2.4"
          when using pkg-config.

	* Added SoupSessionFeature, an interface type that will be
          used for several new features. Ported SoupLogger and
          SoupAuthManager to use it.

	* Added SoupCookie and SoupCookieJar. This API is already
          being used in Epiphany, via WebKit, but it is not yet
          complete.

	* Fixed GnuTLS support on Win32. [#528752, Marc Maurer]

Changes in libsoup from 2.4.0 to 2.4.1:

	* Fixed SoupMessage to not downgrade to HTTP/1.0 for the
          second attempt when it receives an HTTP/1.0 redirect or 401.
          [#521848, Tommu Komulainen]

	* Fixed Host: header syntax when the host is an IPv6 address
          literal.

	* Fixed SoupSession to not emit "authenticate" multiple times
	  for messages that have been requeued. [#522601, Tommi
	  Komulainen]. Also added two new signals to SoupSession,
	  request-queued and request-unqueued, to help simplify
	  certain session-helpers and avoid bugs like this in the
	  future.

	* Fixed soup_server_pause_message() to actually work (rather
          than *un*pausing the message).

	* Added a property SOUP_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT that can be used
          to set a timeout after which idle connections will
          automatically be closed. [#518214, Jorn Baayen]

	* Implemented RFC 2069-style Digest auth, and fixed SoupAuth
          to compare auth scheme names case-insensitively, to fix
          authentication against Apple's calendar server. [#498484]

	* Fixed a crash in SoupAuthDomainDigest if the client provided
          an unrecognized username. [pointed out by Curtis Magyar on
          IRC]

	* Fixed a few SoupDate bugs. (In particular, it was outputting
          the wrong day of the week when stringifying dates.)

	* Improved the cleanup of idle connections, to fix slow load
          times with the libsoup backend of WebKit.

	* Added a new SoupMessage signal "wrote-body-data" that can be
          used for progress information when sending a large request
          body. Also allow providing the request body in multiple
          chunks even when using Content-Length encoding. [#525101,
          Christian Kellner]

	* libsoup now ignores SIGPIPE globally, instead of
          un-thread-safe-ly ignoring it only around network writes. In
          particular, this means it is ignored when the SSL code needs
          to unexpectedly do a write when we asked it to do a read.
          [#524397, Curtis Magyar]

	* The discard-body-chunks-once-they're-no-longer-needed
          behavior, confusingly called SOUP_MESSAGE_OVERWRITE_CHUNKS,
          is now controlled by a SoupMessageBody method
          (soup_message_body_set_accumulate()), and can be applied to
          either the request body or the response body.
          (OVERWRITE_CHUNKS is still available for backward
          compatibility.) [#522146, Christian Kellner]

	* The DNS cache no longer caches "no such host" results, since
          some name servers lie to clients outside their firewall,
          which could then cause problems for laptops moved between
          networks. [#523269, Jörgen Scheibengruber]

	* Added some new regression tests, fixed some small bugs in
          the existing ones.

Changes in libsoup from 2.3.4 to 2.4.0:

	* Fixed a small memory leak in SoupSession. [#518798, Wouter
          Cloetens]

	* Minor fixes to redirect behavior; PROPFINDs can now be
          automatically redirected (pointed out by Christian Kellner),
          and 302 is treated like 307, not 303. Also fixed to make
          sure that redirect-test actually gets run by "make check".

	* The SoupSocket I/O methods now set nread/nwrote even on
          error. [Benjamin Otte]

Changes in libsoup from 2.3.2 to 2.3.4:

	* The documentation should be accessible from devhelp again
          [#518384, Mart Raudsepp]. (Also fixed another
          documentation-generation bug that affected builds from svn,
          but not the 2.3.2 tarball for some reason. [#518317,
          Benjamin Otte].)

	* Fixed dependencies in libsoup-2.4.pc file [#517631,
          Sebastian Dröge]

Changes in libsoup from 2.3.0.1 to 2.3.2:

	API changes / Behavior changes:

	* soup_server_add_auth_domain() now refs the auth domain when
          adding it. (soup_server_remove_auth_domain() already
          unreffed it.) This means existing applications using
          SoupAuthDomain will now have a small memory leak. Those
          applications should update their libsoup-2.4 requirement to
          ">= 2.3.2" at some point before the final GNOME 2.22.0
          release, and then fix the code to unref the auth domain
          after adding it to the server.

	* SoupSession's automatic redirect-handling behavior now obeys
          RFC 2616 more closely. In particular, status codes 300 and
          304 are no longer mistakenly considered redirects; POSTs
          that receive 303 are now redirected into GETs; and POSTs
          that receive 301, 302, or 307 are now not redirected.

	  Applications that were using the SOUP_MESSAGE_NO_REDIRECT
	  flag to prevent libsoup from redirecting POSTs incorrectly
	  before should now be able to remove that if they depend on
	  libsoup-2.4 >= 2.3.2.

	API additions:

	* Added a SOUP_SESSION_USER_AGENT property to SoupSession, and
          SOUP_SERVER_SERVER_HEADER to SoupServer, to support
          automatically adding "User-Agent" and "Server" headers to
          messages. (The default behavior is to do nothing, as
          before.)

	* Added several new methods to soup-forms.h. Applications that
          are encoding a fixed set of form fields can now just pass
          them to soup_form_encode(), rather than needing to construct
          a GHashTable or GData list. (Likewise, the new
          soup_uri_set_query_from_fields() behaves similarly for
          directly updating a URI with form data.) There are also now
          soup_form_request_new() and other related methods, to
          directly create a GET or POST SoupMessage for submitting a
          form query.

	  The original soup_form_* methods have all been renamed,
	  although #defines exist for backward compatibility.

	* Added soup_message_set_chunk_allocator() and
	  soup_buffer_new_with_owner(), to give applications more
	  control over memory usage/copying when doing streaming HTTP.
	  [Wouter Cloetens, #513810].

	* Added several new methods to soup-value-utils.h for working
          with multiple array or hash table values at once:
          soup_value_hash_new_with_vals(),
          soup_value_hash_insert_vals(),
          soup_value_hash_lookup_vals(),
          soup_value_array_new_with_vals(), and
          soup_value_array_append_vals().

	  This helps to simplify XML-RPC calls that send or receive
          structs or arrays.

	* Added soup_date_to_time_t().

	* Added SoupMessageHeadersIterator, an iterator type for
          SoupMessageHeaders that can be used instead of
          soup_message_headers_foreach().

	Bug fixes:

	* Fixed a crash-when-idle in evolution-exchange [#437835] and
          rhythmbox [#506552].

	* Added the API version to the gtk-doc installation dir, to
          prevent parallel-installation problems with libsoup 2.2 and
          2.4. [#512810, Daniel Gryniewicz].

	* Fixed tests/query-test to compile correctly on Solaris.
          [#513602, patch from Jeff Cai]

	* Fixed some other minor HTTP conformance issues.

	Python bindings:

	* Although not present in the release tarball, there are now
          experimental python bindings for libsoup in GNOME subversion
          (in the python/ subdirectory of libsoup trunk). These are
          not yet stable (and are not built by default or installed
          even when building from svn), but comments on them are
          welcome at libsoup-list@gnome.org

Changes in libsoup from the 2.2 series to 2.3.0.1:

	libsoup 2.3.0 is the first beta release of the libsoup 2.4
        series. It is an API break from the earlier 2.2 series that
        fixes various bugs and API warts and lays the groundwork for
        language bindings and various new features in upcoming
        releases.

	(2.3.0.1 is identical to the 2.3.0 release in terms of code,
	but includes this updated NEWS file which was accidentally
	left out of the 2.3.0 tarball.)

	http://library.gnome.org/devel/libsoup/unstable/libsoup-porting-2.2-2.4.html
	goes over the API changes in detail. If you have questions not
	answered by the porting document, please send mail to
	libsoup-list@gnome.org.

	Specific user-reported bugs fixed in this release:

	* SoupURI now correctly handles URIs with complex encoded
          queries [#266516, Jean-Yves Lefort]

	* It is now possible for a SoupServer to use Digest auth
          without needing to have the cleartext password available.
          [#347108, Anas Nashif]

	* Digest authentication now properly handles "stale=true" and
          "nextnonce=..." [#471380, Jari Urpalainen]

	* SoupServer is now subclassible [#491653, Mathias Hasselmann]

	* soup_server_run_async and soup_server_quit no longer ref and
          unref the server, as that doesn't match ordinary GObject
          conventions [#494128, Mathias Hasselmann]

	* The test programs no longer use a symbol name that conflicts
          with Cygwin [#501631, Cygwin Ports Maintainer]

	* libsoup can now handle the not-quite-HTTP responses returned
          by Shoutcast servers [#502325, Wouter Cloetens]

	* If you use libsoup while disconnected from the network, it
          no longer caches the failed DNS results [#508593, Bradley
          Worley]

	Items from http://live.gnome.org/LibSoup/ToDo fixed:

	* "Expect: 100-continue" processing now works correctly on
	  both client and server.

	* SoupSessions are no longer leaked

	* The XML-RPC API is improved. The SOAP API is gone...

	* Added utility functions for HTML form handling

	* Improved message header handling

	* SoupServer now automatically adds a "Date" header

==========

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.103 to 2.2.104:

	* soup_message_io_pause() and soup_message_io_pause() are now
	  allowed for client messages (and in particular, they don't
	  mess up when called from the "got_chunk" callback).
	  [#452280, Marco Barisione]

	* Fixed some bugs in SOUP_SESSION_ASYNC_CONTEXT support that
	  would cause parts of an operation to run in the default
	  context rather than the session's context. Also fixed some
	  leaks and added a regression test. [#498509, Wouter
	  Cloetens]

	* There is a new test/sample program, tests/pull-api.c,
	  showing how to implement a pull API using SoupSessionAsync.
	  (This depends on the fixes for #452280 and #498509, so it
	  won't work with older versions of libsoup.)

	* Discovered "valgrind --leak-resolution=med" and fixed some
          more memory leaks.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.102 to 2.2.103:

	* Fix memory corruption in SoupSessionAsync that caused
          rhythmbox to crash. [#484988, patch from Rob Bradford]

	* Fix socket refcounting in SoupServer to fix warnings /
          possible crash. [#459896, Emanuele Aina]

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.101 to 2.2.102:

	* Unbreak the build when building without SSL. Not that you
          should be building without SSL anyway, but... (reported by
          guenther).

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.100 to 2.2.101:

	* Fix build on cygwin [384498]

	* Fix SSL rehandshaking on synchronous sockets [415402, Jacob
          Berkman] and add a regression test for it.

	* Fix two bugs in https tunnels over proxies that require
	  authentication (noticed by Varadhan), and add a regression
	  test for them.

	* Ensure that if you queue multiple messages at once to an
	  http server that requires authentication but that you
	  haven't authenticated to yet, that all of the messages get
	  properly authenticated [271540, James Willcox]. And add a
	  regression test for it.

	* Fix NTLM authentication, which got broken by the previous
          fix. [471389, Varadhan]. Add a basic NTLM regression test
          that doesn't really test the crypto/encoding parts, but at
          least makes sure that the message flow is correct.

	* Allow trailing whitespace after HTTP version in
          Response-Line, for compatibility with broken servers
          [475169, Stephane Loeuillet]. Add that case to the
          header-parsing regression test.

	* Fix crash when the session's "authenticate" handler returns
	  a username and no password when using NTLM. [480987, Wendell
	  MacKenzie]

	* Use "new" glib base64 and iso8601 methods rather than
          duplicating them. [337010, patch from Emmanuele Bassi].

	* Implement soup_session_queue_message() for SoupSessionSync.

	* Add G_BEGIN_DECLS / G_END_DECLS to all headers that were
          missing them. [438776, patch from Jonathon Jongsma].

	* Fix broken definition of SOUP_IS_MESSAGE_FILTER_CLASS. Noted
          by "cascardo" on libsoup-list.

	* Remove documentation of non-public MD5 methods [440092,
          Jonathon Jongsma]. Removed a mysterious half-sentence in the
          SoupMessage docs [458116, Marco Barisione].

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.99 to 2.2.100:

	* Fixed soup_headers_parse_status_line() so WebDAV response
          parsing will work again. [406997]

	* Fixed a bug in the header-parsing regression test that
          caused the test to fail sometimes, even though the actual
          header-parsing code was fine.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.98 to 2.2.99:

	* Fixed header parsing, including a crash in SoupServer with
          certain malformed requests [391970].

	* Fixed redirection to other hosts with SoupSessionAsync.
          [382251]

	* Fixed a small memory leak pointed out by Chris Austin.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.97 to 2.2.98:

	* The XML-RPC code now correctly interprets <value>foo</value>
	  as meaning the same thing as
	  <value><string>foo</string></value>. [364490] Pointed out by
	  Todd Kulesza.

	* Memory leak fixes from Andrew W. Nosenko.

	* A few symbols that should have been static before now are.
	  [376387] Patch from Matthias Clasen.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.96 to 2.2.97:

	* Fixed SOAP and XML-RPC code to handle whitespace and
          comments in the XML better. (Based on a patch from Andrew W.
          Nosenko.)

	* Fixed lots of typecasting/constness warnings in the code
          (mostly via a patch from Andrew W. Nosenko)

	* Fixed build on Cygwin [321827]

	* Fixed libsoup-2.2.pc fields [343340] and make it get
          uninstalled correctly [356809]. (Mikhail Zabaluev and
          Matthew Barnes)

	* Fixed some small leaks in SoupServer pointed out by Paolo
          Borelli. [351500]

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.95.1 to 2.2.96:

	* SoupServer now works even if you don't explicitly set an
	  encoding for the response. (In particular, the automatic 404
	  if you request a path with no handlers now works. Problem
	  pointed out by Dennis Jacobfeuerborn.)

	* WWW-Authenticate and Proxy-Authenticate responses with no
          realm parameter are now ignored, as per RFC 2617, fixing a
          crash pointed out by Nate Nielsen.

	* Added soup_xmlrpc_message_from_string(), from Fernando
          Herrera [348532].

	* simple-httpd and "get" now support HEAD

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.94 to 2.2.95.1:

	* Even more fixes to XML-RPC, found by the new XML-RPC
          regression test. This includes some API changes that I don't
          feel guilty about, because the code totally didn't work at
          all before.

	* Fixed a bug in soup_mktime_utc()

	* (2.2.95 was identical to 2.2.95.1. The only difference is
	  that the shared library version was belatedly bumped from
	  8.2.0 to 8.3.0 to reflect the API "additions")

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.93 to 2.2.94:

	* Various fixes to the XML-RPC code (which apparently had not
	  actually ever worked before) from Brent Smith. [343973,
	  344222, 344458]

	* Added client and server API tutorials to the docs

	* auth-test now uses a local Apache 2.2 install, if possible,
          rather than depending on files that used to be on an old
          Ximian web server but haven't been anywhere for a long time.
	  [311825]

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.92 to 2.2.93:

	* Fixed outgoing data corruption caused when SoupServer
          started writing out a response a second time after already
          having started once. [334469]. Also fixed 342640 and another
          bug caused by the workaround for 334469 in 2.2.92. Based on
          patches and analysis from William Jon McCann and Armin
          Bauer.

	* Fixed a deadlock when changing a session's proxy URI.
          [309867 / bnc 174255, based on a patch by Veerapuram
          Varadhan].

	* Fixed https-via-proxies in the synchronous case. [bnc 174255]

	* Fixed a crash in evolution-exchange [342545, fix based on an
          analysis by Wang Xin].

	* Fixed simple-proxy to not crash at startup. Oops. (Alex
          Larsson)

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.91 to 2.2.92:

	* Fixed server-side digest auth to return a valid "algorithm"
	  value and client-side to not crash if it sees an invalid one
	  [328615].

	* Fixed the Request-Line parsing code to not hardcode a
          maximum URI length (to allow very long DAAP requests from
          iTunes in Rhythmbox). [335040]

	* Fixed some warnings (signed/unsigned mismatch).

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.7 to 2.2.91:

	* (The large version number bump is because there was an
	  internal 2.2.90 release for SUSE 10.1 alphas, which was
	  supposed to be intermediate between 2.2.7 and 2.4.0. But
	  2.4.0 didn't end up happening, and I don't want to regress
	  the version number at this point.)

	* SoupSession, SoupServer, SoupConnection, SoupSocket, and
          SoupAddress now have an "async-context" property that allows
          you to use the async API in a non-default GMainContext.
          [Based on patches from Armin Bauer and Jürg Billeter.]

	* SoupSession, SoupConnection, and SoupSocket now have a
          "timeout" property to stop synchronous sockets from hanging
          forever if the remote end is unresponsive (from Varadhan).

	* Fixed some bugs in soup_date_iso8601_parse(). [324671, from
          Emmanuele Bassi]

	* More Windows build fixes from Tor.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.6.1 to 2.2.7:

	* Fixed a crash when using NTLM connections [316313, probably
	  also 318252]. (Also 321208, which was a bug introduced in
	  the original fix for 316313.)

	* Fixed a bug that could cause soup to suck up all available
          CPU when a connection to a SoupServer was dropped by the
          other side [319305, patch from Jonathan Matthew]

	* Fixed the creation of struct elements in XMLRPC messages
	  [321362, patch from Sebastian Bauer]

	* Plugged a small memory leak in SoupSocket (from Wang Xin).

	* Fixed two compile problems, a gccism [320349, patch from
          Roland Illig], and a strict-aliasing warning from gcc 4.1.

Changes in libsoup from 2.2.6 to 2.2.6.1:

	* Fixed a crash when using SoupSoapMessage

Changes from 2.2.5 to 2.2.6:

	* Fixed a crash when canceling a message (from Tambet Ingo)

	* Fixed a bug where a connection could be leaked forever in
          some circumstances if a request got a 30x, 401, or 407
          response, eventually causing a hang when the session hit its
          maximum connection limit. (Dan/Tambet)

	* Fixed a memory leak. (Tambet)

	* Fixed a bug that would sometimes show up when connecting to
	  a server on localhost [#312540]

	* Added some API to SoupServer and SoupSocket to help fix a
          long-standing rcd bug.

Changes from 2.2.4 to 2.2.5:

	* Win32 support (from Tor Lillqvist)

	* Up-to-date API documentation pretty much everywhere

	* Basic XMLRPC support (from Mariano Suarez-Alvarez, Fernando
	  Herrera, and Jeff Bailey)

	* New HTTP timestamp-manipulation methods soup_date_parse,
	  soup_date_generate, and soup_date_iso8601_parse.

	* SoupSession now handles relative URLs in the Location header
          (in violation of RFC 2616, but in line with how some servers
          behave.) [270688]

Changes from 2.2.3 to 2.2.4:

	* Fixed a problem with NTLM authentication against
	  multi-domain servers. [306877]

	* Fixed DNS lookups on Solaris. [254551, 268389]

Changes from 2.2.2 to 2.2.3:

	* Now compiles against gnutls 1.2.0 [257811]

	* Fixed a bug that could result in 100% CPU usage if an SSL
	  server closed the connection uncleanly. [273352]

Changes from 2.2.1 to 2.2.2:

	* The SSL validation fix from 2.2.1 [264414] is now completely
          fixed. (Part of the fix didn't actually make it into 2.2.1)

	* HTTPS certificate validation now works when using an HTTP
          proxy. [268583]

	* HTTP proxy code deals better with proxies that try to make
          the user do HTML-form-based authentication. [268531]

	* 64-bit fixes for NTLM auth code. [270323, from Michael
          Zucchi]

Changes from 2.2.0 to 2.2.1:

	* Updated for a libgcrypt API change between 1.1.9x and 1.2.x
          that caused a crash at runtime if you compiled against
          1.2.x. [266342]

	* SSL certificate validation failure should now always result
          in a status of SOUP_STATUS_SSL_FAILED, rather than getting
          turned into SOUP_STATUS_IO_ERROR. [264414]


Changes in libsoup from the 2.0 series (1.99.x versions) to 2.2:

	* Most of the libsoup datatypes are now GObjects. (SoupUri
	  is currently an exception to this.)

		* SoupMessage now emits signals at various stages of
	          processing. (Eg, "wrote_body", "got_headers".) (You
	          can also still use soup_message_add_*handler().)

	* SoupContexts are gone; soup_message_new() now takes a URI
	  string.

	* All formerly global state is now maintained by the
          SoupSession object. (This includes the connection pool,
          proxy server, cached authentication information, SSL
          certificates, etc.)

		* You can create a SoupSessionAsync (for 2.0-like
		  behavior) or SoupSessionSync (for blocking,
		  synchronous usage).

		* You can add SoupMessageFilter objects to a session
                  to have certain processing automatically performed
                  on every message sent via that session. (Eg, setting
                  up handlers.)

		* NTLM authentication is no longer supported by
	          default. You must enable it by setting the
		  SOUP_SESSION_USE_NTLM flag on the session.

		* The preferred method of handling authentication is
	          now via the "authenticate" and "reauthenticate"
	          signals on SoupSession. (The old style, of encoding
	          the user and password information into the url is
	          also still supported.)

	* The SOUP_ERROR_* values are now SOUP_STATUS_* (so that we
          don't have "SOUP_ERROR_OK" and the like).

		* SOUP_MESSAGE_IS_ERROR() is gone, since some cases
		  want to include 3xx responses and some don't.

		* SOUP_ERROR_CANT_AUTHENTICATE and
                  SOUP_ERROR_CANT_AUTHENTICATE_PROXY are now gone,
                  since they didn't carry any information that
                  SOUP_STATUS_UNAUTHORIZED and
                  SOUP_STATUS_PROXY_UNAUTHORIZED don't.

		* DNS errors now show up as the new status code
		  SOUP_STATUS_CANT_RESOLVE rather than being mixed in
		  with SOUP_ERROR_CANT_CONNECT.

	* Minimal SOAP support has been added back, via
          SoupSoapMessage/SoupSoapResponse

	* The HTTP I/O state machine was completely rewritten, fixing
	  numerous crashes, leaks, and protocol errors.

	* SoupUri now conforms to RFC 2396. Mostly.

	* Various test programs have been added under tests/

	* Removed:

		* Support for OpenSSL (which was horribly buggy) and
		  Mozilla NSS (which was never finished). We only
		  support GNUTLS for SSL now.

		* SOCKS support

		* CGI support in SoupServer
