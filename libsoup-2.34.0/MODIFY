Description of change made in libsoup to make it coordinate with Quark

The libsoup library takes care of cookie handling and network
connection via HTTP/HTTPS protocols for Webkit used as a tab process
for Quark. We redirect all cookie handling and socket creation done in
libsoup to the browser kernel.

The changed we made is centralized in one file ./libsoup/soup-quark.c.
In the file, there are functions to communicate with the browser
kernel. 

The list of changes we made in other existing libsoup files are as
follows.

./libsoup/soup-cookie-jar.c 
-- soup_cookie_jar_get_cookies() 

./libsoup/soup-socket.c
-- soup_socket_connect_sync ()
-- soup_socket_connect_async ()
