Quark: A Web Browser with a Formally Verified Kernel
====================================================

Quark 0.1 is a web browser whose kernel is formally verified using [Coq proof assitant](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coq).  Quark was originally announced at [goto.ucsd.edu/quark](http://goto.ucsd.edu/quark/http://goto.ucsd.edu/quark/), with a link to a [source code tarball](http://goto.ucsd.edu/quark/quark-0807.tar.gzhttp://goto.ucsd.edu/quark/quark-0807.tar.gz).  However, there didn't seem to be a public version control repository anywhere, and sometimes academic code has a tendency to drop off the Net or at least disappear from its original publication site.  This copy is meant to make sure Quark is preserved in a place where people can easily get it, fork it if they need to, etc.  If Quark ever gets a home on a real public development site, then this copy can go away.

So please remember that this copy is not the official home of Quark, and check the original site for updates ([goto.ucsd.edu/quark](http://goto.ucsd.edu/quark/http://goto.ucsd.edu/quark/)).  See also the 2012 Usenix Security tech report by Dongseok Jang, Zachary Tatlock, and Sorin Lerner: [Establishing Browser Security Guarantees through Formal Shim Verification](http://goto.ucsd.edu/quark/usenix12.pdf).
